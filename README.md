# Plutonium T5SP Mule Kick Perk Machine Server Fix
This mod fixes the Mule Kick having inconsistent spawns after a server rotates a map. This is a temporary fix and in later updates to pluto hopefully this will be obselete.

# Other Notes
* The mod is almost 1:1 replica to the original mule kick perk, though on Ascension the monkeys won't go after it.
* This mod is **ONLY MEANT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS ONLY** - this will not work on solo or private match because Mule Kick works just as fine on them.
* Like I said this is temperary fix. If a future update does fix this issue, refrain from using this mod.

# Instalation
Download latest version and extract contents to `%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t5`.
